         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>
		In Upper Egypt, making up a part of the Nome IV, the Ancient Egypt site of Medamud is located. It is found east of the Nile, about 5 kilometers northeast of Karnak, in the Theban Nome. It is comprised of sanctuaries, temples, tombs, and statues. One of the structures of greatest significance at this site is that of the Temple of Montu. This temple was created, and worked upon, for many years. It is in honor of the god Montu, who was revered as one of the most important and powerful gods in Ancient Egypt. He is said to be the ruler of the four sites: Armant, Karnak, Tod and Medamud. Montu is critical in the understanding of the site of Medamud during this time.

<h3>Description of the Site</h3>
<hr>
<p>The set up of the site is that of a traditional Graeco-Roman temple. It begins with a large platform which looks over a canal, then the main entrance which is preceded by a smaller court. Following the small court is a larger courtyard and then a portico, a building supported by pillars and a large sanctuary. The floors of the corridors are covered with sand. </p>


		 
<br>
<h3>Discussion of Excavations- both past and present</h3>
<hr>
<p>Until Albert Daninos conducted a brief site survey in early 1900s, Medamud had not undergone any archaeological investigations. Following this survey, from 1925 to 1932, French archaeologist Fernand Bisson de la Roque lead a team of archaeologists from the French Institute of Archaeology, Cairo to excavate this site. From then on, Alexandre Varille and Clément Robichon lead the site’s excavation until 1939. Since that year, there has been no further excavations of Medamud (1).</p>  

<br>
<h3>Results and Significance of Excavations</h3>
<hr>
<p>The excavations done at Medamud reveal a site which has been built and rebuilt over 2000 years, by numerous rulers. 

During the excavations under the French Institute of Archaeology in the early twentieth century, the earliest known structure at Medamud was uncovered. It’s primary structure is an enclosure with straight sides, which has been identified as a sanctuary. It was constructed during the middle kingdom of mud brick 5.5 meters thick. The use of the mud brick allowed it to be classified as early architecture, while there are some elements of stone that were found within the architecture of the structure. Stones used in the construction of the temple built by Senwosret III were used multiple times in future foundations. There is also evidence of rarely-used sandstone and limestone in the columns of the the Senwosret III temple in a doorway. This particular doorway was named with the phrase “Senwosret, who drives the evil away from the Lord of Thebes who lives in Medamud.” (2). 
The earliest built structure at Medamud is a sanctuary, which was unique in its structure. It was a sealed-off polygonal area which contained a courtyard followed by two deeper courts, or sanctuaries, containing tombs. The remains of the tombs are unavailable due to the flood from the Aswan High Dam in the 1970s. There is only the structural remains available for analysis today.
 

<br>
Traveling directly straight through this enclosure, there is found one pylon after another. This leads to a larger sunken in sanctuary dated by ceramics to the First Intermediate Period.Inscriptions on the walls are found to begin during the reign of Sensuret III of the 12th Dynasty. There are also various inscriptions and evidence of the 13 Dynasty kings present. The most work completed on this sanctuary was during the New Kingdom’s 18th Dynasty, under Tuthmose III and his son Amenhotep II. Regardless of this relatively recent work, the only remaining evidence of Amenhotep II is a red doorway made of granite. This doorway portrays Amenhotep II before the god Montu (2).  
<br>
<br>
One of the most recently built temples at Medamud can be seen as a tribute to the god Montu. Montu, in Ancient Egypt, was once record as a strong and prominent god. He is called the god of war. Montu was originally revered as a god of the son; specifically of the heat from the sun. Until the god Amon grew in importance, Montu was the focal figure in Theban life. However Montu was portrayed, as a man with either a falcon or bull’s head, he was representative of a warrior. He also was discovered to play a part in the practice of marriage. Montu was found referenced in marriage documents, as an assurance that the two partners would remain committed to each other and not commit infidelity. He was the god of Karnak, Tod, Armant, and Medamud. It was said that the four heads that Montu sometimes wore were representative of these four locations and his rule over them. 
. 
<br>
<br>
Tiberius, ruler of the Ancient Egyptian Empire from 14-37 AD, was acknowledged for building the primary entrance to the temple. 
The construction of this temple is unique in its layout. It demonstrates some classic orientations, such as the main west-east axis situation of the principle temple. However, uniquely, this temple’s entrance consists of three kiosks which form the portal for entrance.These kiosks are marked with the name of Ptolemy XII.  Directly through the entrance, there can be found the grandest area; that of the court of Antonius Pius. Antonius Pius was a Roman emperor from 138 to 161. This columned courtyard, which contains an alter and is still standing today, is referred to as the “Hall of Justice.” 
 
<br>
<br>

While the evidence and basic structure of the courtyard is still visible, remains of the columns built by Ptolemy VIII include only a few larger columns. Continuing through the temple from the courtyard, there is a chamber whose ceiling is supported by pillars. This was built by Ptolemy VIII, but similar to the courtyard, only a few columns remain as evidence of this work (2). 
Some of the best preserved remains at the temple of Montu are the many houses for priests and rooms for storage.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<hr>
<p>The excavations of Medamud reveal a site which has been in use for more than 2000 years. The original mud brick enclosure was erected in the First Intermediate period. Later, it was built upon by Senwosret III. He constructed the temple in dedication to the god Montu. During the New Kingdom, Thutmose III transformed the site. Later, many pharaohs worked on expanding the central buildings. Little was changed at Medamud during the Ramesside Period, but during the Ptolemaic era, two new larger temples were constructed. The final changes made to the site were by Tiberius, successor to  the emperor Augustus, who built a large gate around the entrance (3).</p>
